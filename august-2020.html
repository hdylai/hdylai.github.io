        I have looked forward to summer this entire past year. August was one of the most emotionally exhausting months, and also a month characterized by extreme lethargy.

          This month, I finished my first round of signage designs and illustrations (an unofficial mascot!) for <a href="https://www.sendchinatownlove.com/resource-center/employee-and-guest-safety-protocol" target="_blank">Send Chinatown Love</a>, cried for the first time since coming home, had more outdoor takeout meals and spontaneous backyard hangs with hometown friends, purchased my most expensive pair of pants to date, drove home from SF a.k.a. the farthest drive I've done in CA, used Figma to layout my <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/1AqN8xpBFJYr5a5a2kmQwh/Storage-plan?node-id=0%3A1" target="_blank">storage unit</a>, finally finished <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43126457-trick-mirror" target="_blank">Trick Mirror</a>, found a local bookstore, read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52845775-minor-feelings" target="_blank">Minor Feelings</a>, had a long talk with mom that helped alleviate some pains on our relationship, helped Tiff rebrand her <a href="http://instagram.com/cloudsandcreamco" target="_blank">baking business</a>, & read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35721123-how-to-write-an-autobiographical-novel" target="_blank">How to Write an Autobiographical Novel</a>.

          Moving is so anxiety inducing, coordinating one remotely is even more so. Every time I dared to open a window and tackle part of the planning (looking into movers, storage units, size of storage units, types of locks??, etc.), 3 hours of time was guaranteed to be sucked away. Thanks to Esther, our belongings in NYC were successfully moved into a storage unit in Brooklyn, where they'll be until we (hopefully, God-willing) move back after to the city after the holidays. I miss the city, I miss being in close physical proximity to my friends, I miss seeing my coworkers at 1WTC.

          I had to restrain myself from finishing Alexander Chee's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35721123-how-to-write-an-autobiographical-novel" target="_blank">How to Write an Autobiographical Novel</a> in less than three sittings and adored it. It was a book which truly reminded me why I enjoy reading, & how powerful good writing is to allow readers to take in and steward the weight of someone one else's lived experiences. There's a posture of humility that is continuously prevalent; Chee is certainly a very accomplished writer, his achievements are duly noted throughout his essays. However, there's a sense of grace even in these pieces centered on his life, his experiences, that I find quite rare, a self-awareness that lends itself to sincerity rather than egotism. If this wasn't obvious already, he is my new literary crush.

          Recently, inspired by the book and recent conversations with Sarah & SHK about portfolio revivals, I've been thinking about the futility of writing & creating <p-alt><span>"about me"</span></p-alt> pages. As noted in a hastily scrawled journal entry, how do we manifest an online identity without it becoming an artifact that merely upholds the measly status quo of designers to <p-alt><span>'have a voice?'</span></p-alt>
          <br> <br>
          In conversations with friends, it's evident that we life such fruitful lives outside of our work; we have hobbies that keep us excited, friends to keep us grounded and supported. And yet, in our little corners of the internet, we conform to such linear formulas to represent ourselves — this is our present, this is our past, this is a line to demonstrate that we have a life outside of work. Why do we diminish ourselves so? I half-jokingly texted Sarah in the midst of our shared futility, perhaps the key to our anxiety may be to simply create a bot / script to scrape through our social media profiles and write a profile for us with information that's already out in the virtual space — <p-alt><span>"Hilary is a designer; on this day one year ago, she was hanging out with her friends Soonho, Julia, and Eric, accompanied by Hot Cheetos and the last of their leftover supply of beer (source: Instagram)."</span></p-alt>
          <br> <br>
          It feels especially compelling in these uncertain times to change the paradigm of the supposed gravity of these public self-reflections, to reflect in the ways we trade-off between our physical and digital presences, and put more effort into reclaiming some breathing room & not taking ourselves too seriously.
